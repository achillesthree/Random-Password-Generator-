# Random-Password-Generator-

## Description

The project was to refactor the codebase for a marketing agency that meets accessibility standards so that the website is optimized for search engines. The reason why was so that I could get a better understanding of improving existing code without changing what it does. The solved problem will enable the marketing agency to get more traffic to the site. I learned many things, but commenting in the CSS sheet was huge for me. Describing what I see then I'll be able to create easier and faster.

## Features

Since we were "only" refactoring, I didn't add any features. That said, I was charged with using Semantic HTML Elements to help clean up existing code and to that end I added these tags: header, body, section, figure, main, article, and nav tags. I also added alt attributes to specifiy an alternate text for an image, if the image cannot be displayed.
